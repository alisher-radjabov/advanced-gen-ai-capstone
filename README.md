# Product Documentation Support Bot ðŸ¤–

A Streamlit-based chatbot that uses LangChain and OpenAI to answer questions about your product documentation.

## Features

- PDF-based document Q&A with citations (file name and page)
- Chat history support
- Streamlit UI
- Support ticket creation mock (Jira integration)
- Uses LangChain + OpenAI under the hood

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo and install requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Set your OpenAI API key in a `.env` file:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
```

3. Put your PDF docs in the `data/` folder.

4. Run the app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Folder Structure

- `data/`: place your PDF documentation here
- `/`: main code files
- `requirements.txt`: dependencies
- `README.md`: this file

## Mock Jira Ticket

When the bot can't find a confident answer, it will offer to create a support ticket with mock Jira integration (prints to console).
